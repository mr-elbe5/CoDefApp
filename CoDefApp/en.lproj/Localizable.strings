    The server software is available as open source at Github under the name 'Bandika Issue Tracker'.
    The app can be connected to a dedicated server. Yet this is only needed if you want to store your data at a central
    location. You can get support for creating and running a dedicated server at www.elbe5.de.";

"mainInfoStructureHeader"="Structure";
"mainInfoStructureText"="The structure includes projects, units and defects.
Additionally it includes a pool of companies for assigning them to one or more projects and to their defects.

Projects can be e.g. construction tasks or buildings. From the pool of all companies the relevant ones are assigned to each project.

Units are parts of the project like a floor or a room. Units can have a (ground )plan, where defects can be marked on.

Defects include a name or short description, a description of the defect, a status, an assignment to a company, a target date, a position and images and/or photos.

Defects are processed using status changes with comment, new status, new assignment and new images or photos.";
