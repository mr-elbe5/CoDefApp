    The server software is available as open source at Github under the name 'Bandika Issue Tracker'.

    location. You can get support for creating and running a dedicated cloud server at www.elbe5.de.";

Additionally it includes a pool of companies for assigning them to one or more projects and to their defects.

Projects can be e.g. construction tasks or buildings. From the pool of all companies the relevant ones are assigned to each project.

Units are parts of the project like a floor or a room. Units can have a (ground )plan, where defects can be marked on.

Defects include a name or short description, a description of the defect, a status, an assignment to a company, a target date, a position and images and/or photos.

Defects are processed using status changes with comment, new status, new assignment and new images or photos.";
